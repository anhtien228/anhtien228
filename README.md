## A ‚Äúbyte‚Äù of me

Since 2020, I've pursued the machine learning/deep learning studies despite of my major in Computer Engineering. After graduating, I've started my first official job in a consumer finance company, and my main works have been on risk modeling using traditional/state-of-the-art machine learning models as well as other data science/data engineering tech stack.

At the moment, I'm trying to devote more of my time for personal growth, and perhaps writing a blog :)
